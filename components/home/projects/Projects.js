        <p>
          I designed a search feature that pulls results from a PostgreSQL database allowing users to filter by product name and category.
        </p>
        <p>
          I familiarized myself with the boilerplate code of hooking up AWS S3 with Flask.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harnessed the power of object relational mapping, using SQLAlchemy, to abstract and manage the database operations, providing a high-level, Pythonic, and more intuitive interface to interact with the underlying SQL database.
        </p>
        <p>
          Successfully implemented dynamic cart features using Redux, allowing seamless addition, removal, and quantity adjustments of products, ensuring accurate price calculations.

          I built a predictive search feature that incorporates Googleâ€™s Places Autocomplete API for geocoding user input to efficiently retrieve spots within a certain location and display them on a map.
        </p>
        <p>
          Utilized the Google Maps JavaScript API to showcase spots as interactive markers, improving the user experience for those seeking 'nests'."

        <p>
          Although I had prior experience with AWS S3, adapting the backend infrastructure to integrate S3 with Express was an fun challenge {":)"}.

          Leveraged React's song player library alongside Redux's capabilities to create an audio controller component that will play, pause or skip the current song.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implemented Reactâ€™s wavesurfer library to visualize a songâ€™s waveform while also displaying the songâ€™s progress in sync with the song player component. This was a tricky but satisfying one!
        </p>
        <p>
          Employed GitHub's version control system to manage our codebase effectively. We divided the project into discrete features, each assigned to a pair of developers. Each pair created a separate branch off the main branch, ensuring an isolated environment for the development of their specific feature. This approach facilitated a clean, organized workflow and reduced the risk of destabilizing the main codebase.
